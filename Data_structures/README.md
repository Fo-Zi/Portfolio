## SUMMARY

This project will contain C implementations of data structures, with unit testing integrated with CMake and Google Tests. 

I choose to implement Unit Tests using GTests because itÂ´s the one i found the easiest to integrate with an existing project that already uses CMake in its structure. I also tried Cppunit and pytest too but this was more straight forward. 

By now there is only a linked list implementation, i will update more soon.
