# Currency Application -> GUI design applying the MVC pattern
## Summary
In this application i try to demonstrate the application of the Model View Controller(MVC) design pattern. This pattern allow us to decouple very well the visualization or graphic side of our app from the functionality behind it. With that purpose i' ve used the API of a bank to retrieve information(Model) that then will be displayed(View) in a user-friendly manner. The resources that i used are:
- [Exchange API](https://exchangerate.host/#/#docs)
- [PyQt5](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython/)
- [Dark Stylesheet](https://github.com/ColinDuquesnoy/QDarkStyleSheet.git)

This is how far the application is developed right now:

I still have a lot of improvements to make and to finish the whole application, but i think it could be of help if you're stuck at the beggining or trying to figure out how to apply the Design Pattern itself.
#### Thanks for pasing by!
